// üìã TYPESCRIPT TYPE DEFINITIONS
// 
// This file defines the structure of data used throughout our application.
// TypeScript interfaces and types help us:
// 1. Catch bugs at compile time (before running the code)
// 2. Get better IDE autocomplete and suggestions
// 3. Make code self-documenting by showing what data looks like
// 4. Ensure consistency across different parts of the app
// 
// WHAT IS AN INTERFACE?
// An interface is like a contract that defines what properties an object must have.
// It's like a blueprint or template for objects.
// 
// WHAT IS A TYPE?
// A type is similar to an interface but can also define unions (A | B) and other complex types.

/**
 * üéôÔ∏è TRANSCRIPTION MESSAGE INTERFACE
 * 
 * This defines the structure of messages we receive from the WebSocket backend.
 * When Deepgram processes audio, it sends us messages with this structure.
 * 
 * ENHANCED FEATURES:
 * Now includes speaker identification, feature status, and enhanced formatting
 * 
 * EXAMPLE MESSAGE:
 * {
 *   type: "transcription",
 *   text: "Hello world",
 *   is_final: true,
 *   speaker: 0,
 *   has_diarization: true,
 *   word_count: 2,
 *   features_used: { diarization: true, punctuation: true, ... }
 * }

 * - Paragraphs: Breaks text into logical paragraph chunks
 * - Punctuation: Adds periods, commas, capitalization automatically

 *   action_items: [{ task: "Review budget", responsible_party: "Speaker 0" }]

/**
 * üîó CONNECTION STATUS TYPE
 * 
 * This is a TypeScript union type - it can be one of several specific string values.
 * It tracks the status of our WebSocket connection to the backend.
 * 
 * UNION TYPE EXPLANATION:
 * Instead of allowing any string, we restrict it to only these specific values.
 * This prevents typos and makes the code more reliable.
 * 
 * STATUS MEANINGS:
 * - 'Disconnected': Not connected to backend
 * - 'Connecting': Attempting to connect
 * - 'Connected': Basic connection established
 * - 'Connected to Deepgram': Connected and Deepgram is ready
 * - 'Enhanced Features Active': All AI features are working
 * - 'Connection Error': Something went wrong

  | 'Connected'                    // Basic WebSocket connection established
  | 'Connected to Deepgram'        // Connected and Deepgram transcription ready
  | 'Enhanced Features Active'     // üÜï NEW: All advanced features working properly
  | 'Connection Error';            // Connection failed or error occurred

/**
 * üìä SUMMARY TYPE
 * 
 * Defines the different types of AI summaries we can request.
 * Each type focuses on different aspects of the transcribed content.
 * 
 * SUMMARY TYPES EXPLAINED:
 * - 'meeting': Comprehensive overview with all sections
 * - 'action_items': Focus only on tasks and to-dos
 * - 'key_points': Extract main takeaways and important points
 * - 'speaker_analysis': üÜï Per-speaker breakdown and analysis

/**
 * üè† APP STATE INTERFACE
 * 
 * This defines the complete state structure of our React application.
 * It includes all the data that the app needs to track and display.
 * 
 * ENHANCED WITH NEW FEATURES:
 * Now includes speaker tracking and feature status monitoring.
 * 
 * STATE MANAGEMENT:
 * In React, "state" is data that can change over time and triggers re-renders
 * when updated. This interface ensures all state has the correct structure.

// üí° TYPESCRIPT TIPS FOR BEGINNERS:
// 
// 1. INTERFACES vs TYPES:
//    - Use 'interface' for object shapes: interface User { name: string; age: number; }
//    - Use 'type' for unions and complex types: type Status = 'loading' | 'success' | 'error'
// 
// 2. OPTIONAL PROPERTIES (?):
//    - name?: string means the property is optional (can be undefined)
//    - name: string means the property is required
// 
// 3. ARRAYS:
//    - string[] means an array of strings: ["hello", "world"]
//    - ActionItem[] means an array of ActionItem objects
// 
// 4. UNION TYPES (|):
//    - string | null means the value can be a string OR null
//    - 'red' | 'blue' | 'green' means only these three specific strings are allowed
// 
// 5. GENERICS (<T>):
//    - Not used in this file, but you might see Array<string> which is the same as string[]
// 
// 6. BENEFITS:
//    - Catches bugs before runtime
//    - Better IDE autocomplete
//    - Self-documenting code
//    - Refactoring safety
